## UCF Coding Bootcamp Week 4 Project
This weeks project was appropriately challenging. Ultimately, i'm not quite satisfied with end product as it's not easily updateable. I met the letter and intent of the lesson, but could be more future-proofed. The process to add questions and answers is very cumbersome and inefficient. The main issue is that I didn't realize the significance or flexibility of key:value pairs. In one of our live lessons, after I had finished the project, I saw the use of key:value pairs that i realized was the answer to the question I had spent hours trying to figure out. So silly. 

Aside from that delima, I learned some more trouble shooting procedures, got to use and become comfortable with web-side API's, figured out some more efficient loops, and making my code more readable.
